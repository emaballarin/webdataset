## Commit: 0.2.86 -> 0.2.88

457c4ce -> f11fd66 @ 2024-03-13 14:39:27 -0700

The README.md for the WebDataset project has been updated with
additional information and examples. The WebDataset format description
has been expanded to clarify the naming convention for tar file shards
and how files within a tar file are associated with each other. The
documentation now includes a Python code snippet demonstrating how
to access and list the contents of a dataset using curl and tar. The
section on related projects has been replaced with a new section on
WebDataset libraries, listing several libraries and tools that support
the WebDataset format, including a Julia implementation and a Golang
command line tool. The webdataset library section has been elaborated
to describe its features, limitations, and usage with PyTorch,
including an example of how to create a dataset instance and check
its type. Finally, a new code example has been added to show how to
preprocess and augment data using the webdataset library and PyTorch.

404b538 -> 457c4ce @ 2023-12-06 21:21:25 -0800

The .sourcery.yaml configuration file has been added with specific rule
settings for code refactoring. In tasks.py, the autoflake task has
been updated to include additional directories, and new tasks isort
and cleanup have been introduced for code formatting. The test task
now explicitly targets the tests directory. Imports in test_cache.py,
test_decode.py, and test_fluid.py have been reorganized, with some
redundant imports removed.  In test_fluid.py, the order of import
statements has been changed. A redundant import has been removed
from test_gopen.py. In test_loaders.py, import statements have been
consolidated into a single line. Only formatting changes.

## Commit: 0.2.84 -> 0.2.85

065208d -> 404b538 @ 2023-12-06 00:09:39 -0800

The test_length assertion in TestIndexedTarSamples has been
simplified to a single line. A blank line has been added before
the TestLRUShards and TestGz classes. In TestShardListDataset, the
instantiation of ShardListDataset has been condensed into a single
line. The assertions comparing the cache contents have been simplified
by removing unnecessary line breaks. The test_spec_parsing method
in TestSpecs has been duplicated, likely by mistake. Overall, the
changes are minor and primarily involve code cleanup and formatting,
with no significant functional alterations.

## Commit: 0.2.83 -> 0.2.84

81bdb5c -> 065208d @ 2023-12-05 16:28:26 -0800

The setup.py script has been modified to update the
version field and change the entry point for widsindex from
webdataset.wids.wids_index:main to wids.wids_index:main. In the
webdataset/__init__.py file, the __version__ string has been
updated accordingly. The wids/wids.py file has seen significant
changes, including the addition of imports for base64 and sqlite3,
the creation of a new hash_localname function that creates a local
cache directory and a SQLite database to store cache information,
and modifications to the ShardListDataset class to handle dataset
names and base URLs, as well as to print verbose information about
the dataset. The default_localname function has been updated to use
URL quoting for the shard name. A new hash_dataset_name function has
been added to generate a hash for the dataset name.

## Commit: 0.2.79 -> 0.2.83

efb4a1e -> 81bdb5c @ 2023-12-05 02:28:06 -0800

The webdataset package has been updated with several changes. The
setup.py file has been modified to include a new entry point
for a console script named widsindex, which points to the
webdataset.wids.wids_index:main function. Additionally, the package
directory for webdataset.wids has been changed to wids. The tasks.py
file has seen the addition of a new task pipx, which installs the
package and injects the torch dependency. The Docker base container
has been updated to use Ubuntu 22.04, and several commented-out lines
related to installing JupyterLab, NumPy, and nbconvert have been
added. The test_cache.py and test_decode.py files have been moved
from the webdataset/tests directory to the tests directory. Only
formatting changes.

## Commit: 0.2.77 -> 0.2.79

8e52bca -> efb4a1e @ 2023-11-22 08:43:16 -0800

The webdataset package has undergone several updates. In wids.py,
when encountering files not in a subdirectory, a warning is now
printed with the file name. The LRUShards class has been modified
to print a download message including the URL, local file path,
and download status to stderr when the WIDS_VERBOSE environment
variable is set. Similarly, the ShardListDataset class now prints
shard information when WIDS_VERBOSE is set. These changes are aimed
at improving the verbosity and logging for debugging purposes.

## Commit: 0.2.76 -> 0.2.77

09db99d -> 8e52bca @ 2023-11-14 14:13:38 -0800

Added gzip support in the default_decoder function within wids.py,
allowing for the decompression of .gz files and handling of streams
accordingly.  Enhanced the TestGz class in test_wids.py with a new test
case test_gz to verify the functionality of reading gzipped files,
ensuring that the sample dictionary contains the expected keys and
values after processing a gzipped text file.

## Commit: 0.2.74 -> 0.2.75

d46f93a -> 3959abb @ 2023-11-09 12:31:00 -0800

Added gzip compression support to the encode_based_on_extension1
function in writer.py, which now compresses data if the target
name ends with .gz.  The function handles both bytes and strings,
compressing them before returning. A new test case test_writer_gz was
added to test_writer.py to verify that a .txt.gz file is correctly
written and read back, ensuring the data is compressed and matches
the expected content.

## Commit: 0.2.73 -> 0.2.74

039f70f -> d46f93a @ 2023-11-08 10:26:20 -0800

The webdataset package has been updated with new functionality. The
WebDataset class in webdataset/compat.py now supports context
management, allowing it to be used with Python's with statement for
better resource management. This is facilitated by the addition of
__enter__ and __exit__ methods.  Additionally, a close method has
been implemented in the DataPipeline class in webdataset/pipeline.py
to close the pipeline properly. A test case test_dataset_context has
been added to webdataset/tests/test_fluid.py to verify the correct
behavior of the WebDataset class when used in a context manager.

## Commit: 0.2.72 -> 0.2.73

The webdataset library has undergone a minor update. The setup.py
and webdataset/__init__.py files reflect an increment in the patch
version number.  In the webdataset/tests/test_wids.py file, a new
test class TestSpecs has been added with two methods for testing
the parsing of dataset specifications from JSON. Additionally,
the webdataset/wids/wids.py file has been refactored to remove the
load_remote_shardlist function and related helper functions, as they
have been moved to a separate module wids_specs. The wids_specs
module is now responsible for handling the loading and parsing of
remote shard lists.

## Commit: 0.2.71 -> 0.2.72

3c40a3e -> e7507c9 @ 2023-10-31 11:02:27 -0700

The webdataset package has undergone several updates. In the
wids.py file, the load_remote_shardlist function has been modified
to handle a string source by opening it as a stream before loading
JSON data. Additionally, a print statement has been added to the
ShardListDataset constructor, and the lengths attribute is now
correctly derived from the self.shards attribute. The add_transform
method in the same class now returns self, allowing for method
chaining. In the wids_index.py file, the main function has been updated
to read file names from stdin if the input is a single hyphen. The
result dictionary now includes a wids_version key, and the name key
is conditionally added only if it is not an empty string. The files
key in the result dictionary has been renamed to shardlist.

## Commit: 0.2.69 -> 0.2.71

a02f440 -> 3c40a3e @ 2023-10-30 10:55:47 -0700

The setup.py and webdataset/__init__.py files have been updated to
reflect a new version. In webdataset/wids/wids.py, a partial function
from the functools module has been introduced to specify the format
for the default decoder. The ShardListDataset class's constructor
now accepts a transformations parameter that can be set to "PIL" or
"numpy" to determine the format of the images. If transformations is
not a list, it is converted into a list, and each transformation is
verified to be callable. Additionally, the default_decoder function has
been updated to raise a ValueError if an unknown format is specified
for image extensions.

## Commit: 0.2.68 -> 0.2.69

4bb1a6b -> a02f440 @ 2023-10-30 10:15:54 -0700

The webdataset package has been updated with a minor change in the
webdataset/wids/wids_mmtar.py file, where a debug print statement
has been removed from the MMIndexedTar class. This change is likely
to clean up the console output during the usage of the library. No
other functional changes or feature additions are indicated by the
diff provided.

## Commit: 0.2.65 -> 0.2.68

5dc6332 -> 4bb1a6b @ 2023-10-28 20:09:23 -0700

The webdataset library has undergone several updates. The setup.py
script no longer requires a clean working tree to increment the
version number. In the autodecode.py module, a .copy() method has
been added to ensure the numpy array is copied when converting to
a PyTorch tensor. The test_decode.py module now imports imread from
imageio.v3 instead of imageio. The wids.py module has been refactored,
with the TarFileReader and find_index_file functions being moved to
separate modules, and the ShardListDataset constructor now supports
an additional use_mmap parameter. Additionally, the ShardedSampler
class has been documented to clarify its purpose in sampling from
a ShardListDataset.

The GitHub Actions workflow for PyPI publishing has been updated
to use a specific release version of the gh-action-pypi-publish
action instead of the master branch. In the webdataset package,
the __init__.py and setup.py files have been modified to reflect
a new package version. Additionally, the wids.py module within the
webdataset package has received several updates: new docstrings have
been added to explain the purpose and usage of functions and classes,
a new ShardListDataset class has been introduced for indexable
datasets based on a list of shards, and a new ShardedSampler class
has been added for sampling in a way that preserves locality. The
ShardListDataset class also includes methods for cache management
and accessing dataset samples.

class's batched method has been refactored for better readability
without altering its functionality. The WebDataset class in the
same file has been enhanced with a new rename_files parameter
in the constructor and in the tariterators.tarfile_to_samples and
caching.cached_tarfile_to_samples methods, allowing for file renaming
during dataset processing. Additionally, the WebDataset constructor
now supports YAML file URLs directly, streamlining the process of
loading dataset specifications.

## Commit: 0.2.47 -> 0.2.49

352089f -> 039d743 @ 2023-03-20 22:08:02 -0700

The webdataset package has undergone several updates to its test
suite. New tests have been added to verify the expected number of
samples in a WebDataset object, both for datasets created from locally
hosted data and resampled data. The test_yaml3 function has been
introduced to create a WebDataset from a YAML specification. Additional
tests have been implemented to check the functionality of the
with_length, repeat, slice, and rsample methods. Error handling has
been addressed with tests for EOF errors, custom decoder errors,
and missing keys in to_tuple and rename methods. The rename method
has been tested for its keep option functionality. The test suite
also includes checks for the shuffle, decode, map, and map_dict
methods, as well as for decoding to RGB8 numpy arrays, PIL images,
and handling compressed data. The test_rgb8_np_vs_torch function has
been added to compare numpy and PyTorch tensor outputs.

The setup.py and webdataset/__init__.py files have been updated
to reflect a new version. In webdataset/compat.py, the WebDataset
class now reads WDS_CACHE_SIZE and WDS_CACHE environment variables
to set cache_size and cache_dir respectively, and checks if the
cache_dir exists. The webdataset/shardlists.py file introduces new
functions envlookup and envsubst to substitute environment variables
with a WDS_ prefix in URLs, and modifies the expand_urls function
to use these substitutions and perform additional checks. Lastly,
webdataset/tests/test_pipeline.py has been updated to reflect the
changes in environment variable handling, using the WDS_ prefix for
the TESTDATA variable.

## Commit: 0.2.35 -> 0.2.39

cb1aa32 -> fa40da2 @ 2023-03-03 17:21:19 -0800

The Python version metadata in readme.ipynb was simplified. In
webdataset/cache.py, error handling was improved to account
for potential race conditions where files might be deleted by
other processes during cleanup operations. An exception type in
webdataset/gopen.py was changed from Exception to IOError to more
accurately reflect errors related to I/O operations.

## Commit: 0.2.31 -> 0.2.34

9bc1eb5 -> cb1aa32 @ 2023-02-01 10:16:51 -0800

The webdataset documentation HTML has been streamlined, with several
meta tags and links to external resources being updated or removed. The
JavaScript references have been modified, including an update to
jQuery and the addition of a conditional comment for supporting
HTML5 elements in older versions of Internet Explorer. The navigation
structure within the HTML has been simplified, with some elements being
removed and others reorganized for clarity. Additionally, the Python
code snippet in the README has been corrected to use loader instead
of dataset when obtaining a batch. New documentation sections have
been added to describe the Length Properties and Tar Header Overhead
for the WebDataset instances, providing guidance on setting dataset
length and handling tar file overhead. Only formatting changes.

## Commit: 0.2.30 -> 0.2.31

8458543 -> 9bc1eb5 @ 2022-11-29 14:31:29 -0800

The .gitignore file has been updated to exclude additional files such
as openimages.py, rust-test.ipynb, test.cbors, test.py, and several
others within the notebooks and webdataset/tests directories. The
requirements.txt file now includes the dataclasses package as a
dependency. In webdataset/autodecode.py, the image_extensions list
has been replaced with a more comprehensive IMAGE_EXTENSIONS list,
which includes a wider range of image file extensions. Additionally,
the ImageHandler and imagehandler functions have been updated to use
the new IMAGE_EXTENSIONS list. The Decoder class has been modified to
handle keys starting with double underscores and to attempt decoding
byte values to UTF-8, with an error message if decoding fails.

## Commit: 0.2.26 -> 0.2.30

6864382 -> 8458543 @ 2022-11-04 12:49:07 -0700

The setup.py script has been updated to reflect a new version. The
tasks.py script has been modified to include a virtual environment
activation and a pytest command before committing changes. In
the webdataset/__init__.py, an import statement for gopen and
gopen_schemes has been added. The gopen.py module has seen several
changes: the set_options function definition has been reformatted,
the gopen_file function now strips the "file:" prefix from URLs,
and the gopen_curl function has been updated to use the -X PUT flag
for write mode. Additionally, an import os statement has been added
to multi.py. The test_gopen.py file has been updated to use the gopen
function directly instead of gopen.gopen.

## Commit: 0.2.25 -> 0.2.26

9f9b0e3 -> 6864382 @ 2022-09-16 21:20:12 -0700

Fixed a bug in autodecode.py related to image decoding, ensuring proper
handling of different image modes (L, RGB, RGBA) and data types (uint8,
float). The ImageHandler class now includes checks for the number of
dimensions and corrects the shape of the array based on the specified
mode. It also includes assertions to verify the mode and array type,
and converts images to the appropriate format for both NumPy and
PyTorch. Additionally, the setup.py file was updated to include a
trailing comma in the install_requires list.
